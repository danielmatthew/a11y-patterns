Per [warning by Adrian Roselli](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/07/aria-grid-as-an-anti-pattern.html#Layout):

> I need to take this opportunity to stress that the ARIA Authoring Practices are not a specification nor standard. They are a [Working Group Note](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#WGNote). They are [not production ready](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#browser_and_AT_support) â€¦
