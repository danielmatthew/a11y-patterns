# a11y-patterns## tabindexThe `tabindex` attribute is only valid on the following elements:- `a`- `area`- `button`- `input`- `object`- `select`- `textarea`However, the W3C specifcation states that:> Those elements that do not support the `tabindex` attribute or support it and assign it a value of "0" are navigated next. These elements are navigated in the order they appear in the character stream.Essentially, any element given a `tabindex` property of 0 may receive focus. You may have used this technique to implement a "Skip to content" link in order to allow users to skip over elements straight to the meat of the page.## Browser behaviour notes### Chrome- Includes links in its normal tab-order### Safari- Tab-order ignores links: only elements with an explicit `tabindex`, or "natural" elements such as a button or input.### Firefox- As with Safari, Firefox will ignore links when navigating through the document with the tabkey.
