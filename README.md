---

A series of [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/)-powered web components, covering widgets described by the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/).


[Adrian Roselli warns against cribbing the widgets wholesale](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/07/aria-grid-as-an-anti-pattern.html#Layout)…

> I need to take this opportunity to stress that the ARIA Authoring Practices are not a specification nor standard. They are a [Working Group Note](https://www.w3.org/2018/Process-20180201/#WGNote). They are [not production ready](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#browser_and_AT_support)

…hence this project.
